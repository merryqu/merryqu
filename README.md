### bye bye~~
i'm a 57-year-old woman hoping to find love. please message if interested. serious inquiries only.

a little more about myself:

i have two cats named rotty and sammy. i'm currently in the process of moving after they turned the sink on and flooded the place while i was in brazil for silicone butt injections. money would be appreciated to help me. 

i have a strong penchant for asian men in their 20s named brandon vo, but i'm flexible about these requirements. 

a wise chipmunk once said `print "hello world"` and i have stuck by this philosophy ever since i was a wee spermatozoid. while i was thrust into this world without consent, i like to remember these comforting words that remind me to live in the moment and embrace this horrifying reality. it is important to live one day at a time and accept situations, whether good or bad--as they come (like when my cats flooded my $390 million mansion), otherwise we would be drowning (like how my house is drowning) in all of our misfortunes.

**update:** it has been _45 days_ and i have still not turned off the faucet. :v:ðŸ˜—

**update 2:** message me if you need help with taxes
